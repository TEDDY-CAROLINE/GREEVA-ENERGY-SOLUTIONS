# GREEVA-ENERGY-SOLUTIONS
Greeva Energy Solutions is a growing U.S.-based renewable energy consultancy that helps corporations, utility providers, and state governments transition to cleaner energy sources. Their clients span various sectors, including industrial manufacturers, commercial real estate firms, and local municipalities
Despite a strong portfolio, Greeva has recently observed slower growth in solar and wind energy adoption among certain sectors. They also face increasing competition from newer players who offer optimized energy mix recommendations backed by advanced analytics.
Using an excel based analysis, this report presents the analysis and findings of the renewable energy findings with a goal of optimizing utilization of available renewable energy resources, how seasonal patterns influence sector wise renewable energy use and to leverage historical renewable energy consumption data across sectors and sources.
# KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
1.	Average renewable energy consumption:  125.35
2.	Total renewable energy consumption: 384189.143
# EXECUTION
Used Excel; cleaning data, analyze and process data, summarized data using pivot tables, forecasting analysis of the data and dashboard to visualise the data
# INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
1.	Trends & Patterns
   
1.1.	the renewable sources that have shown the fastest growth in the recent years are mainly Biomass Gas and Wood energy.

1.2.	Different renewable sources have shown growth in different sectors;

* Commercial sector: Biomass gas

* Electric power: conventional hydroelectric power
  
* Industrial: Biomass gas
  
* Residential:  Wood energy
  
* Transport: Biomass gas and Fuel ethanol excluding denaturant

Recommendations: Biomass gas, conventional hydroelectric power and wood energy are the most utilized renewable energy sources and emphasis should be placed on those for the different sectors respectfully 

2.	Sector Analysis
   
2.1.	Industrial and Electric power have had the most consistent or increasing renewable energy usage 

2.2.	The sectors that lag are Commercial, Transport and Residential in that order.

Recommendations: A closer look should be taken into the factors affecting commercial, transport and residential sectors as to why they are lagging behind.

3.	Seasonality
   
3.1.	Solar energy has lower consumption in winter and shows higher consumption in summer

3.2.	Other energy sources are mostly constant throughout the year and whatever affects them could be something else other than season

Recommendation: An alternative for Solar energy during winter, Prioritize partnerships and marketing efforts based on real usage data and untapped potential 

4.	Forecasting & Strategy
   
Based on historical trends the projected renewable energy with high consumption will be Biomass gas for commercial, electric power, industrial, and Biomass gas for Transport sector

Recommendation: Greeva should recommend the following energy mix strategy to maximise efficiency:

* Commercial:  biomass gas

* Electric power:   conventional hydroelectric power

* Industrial: biomass gas

* Residential: wood energy

* Transport: Biomass gas and fuel ethanol

# CONCLUSION:
This report provides actions actionable insights into trends and patterns of renewable energy consumption across different sectors. Implementing the recommendations will lead to customizing client energy transition strategies by sector, positioning Greeva energy solutions as a data-driven consultancy in a competitive market and Prioritizing partnerships and marketing efforts based on real usage data and untapped potential.
